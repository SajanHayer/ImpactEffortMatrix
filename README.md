# ImpactEffortMatrix
Python code that creates impact effort matrixes for you so you do not have to go through the complexities of an Excel file to do it.

Run this file as you would any normal python file. Fill out the required fields, you can paste in a previous matrix you created so that you can edit it quickly
and make any changes you need. You can also create a csv file from the matrix which was part of the use case for this code. Also you can save the matrix that you created
and this will be in the same folder that you ran the code in. 

The program contains the ability to change many settings as well, you have the ability to increase the range of which you score the impact and effort of a certain item. 
Since I custom created a function that automatically moves labels around a certain point depending on how many items are on that point, this code features the ability 
to change how far a label can be from a point.
